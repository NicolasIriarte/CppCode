  Name:                   HQ9+
  URL:                    https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/133/A
  Time limit per test:    2 seconds.
  Memory limit per test:  256 megabytes.
  Input:                  standart input.
  Output:                 standart output.

  Description:

  HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character
  instructions:

  1. "H" prints "Hello, World!".
  2. "Q" prints the source code of the program itself.
  3. "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song.
  4. "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.

  Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The
  characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.

  You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether
  executing this program will produce any output.

  Input:

  The input will consist of a single line p which will give a program in HQ9+.
  String p will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of
  each character of p will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde),
  inclusive.

  Output:

  Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO"
  otherwise.
